                Rule 1 &mdash; Be Nice
            </Section>
            <ul>
                <li>No harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, hateful language, use of slurs, brigading, witch-hunting, etc.</li>
                <li>
                    In case of other users being disrespectful, disengage from the situation and alert mods if needed; insulting the user back will result in
                    both parties being punished accordingly to their behavior.
                </li>
                <li>Being nice extends to all parties â€” other members, moderators, users not in the global chat, non-TCN servers, etc.</li>
            </ul>

                Rule 2 &mdash; No NSFW/NSFL
            </Section>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most connected servers are strict on NSFW, so even if the server from which you are chatting is lenient on this, it still isn&apos;t
                    allowed.
                </li>
                <li>NSFW/NSFL content includes everything - media, text (including usernames), profile avatars, etc. both explicitly and implicitly.</li>

                <li>Leaks are not allowed in global channels and should be kept to channels in your server that permit leaks.</li>
                <li>This rule applies to both Genshin Impact and any other games / media.</li>
                <li>Mark spoilers, both for Genshin Impact and otherwise (within reason).</li>

                    Do not complain about being banned/muted in another server in the global chat &mdash; if you have an issue with a TCN server&apos;s actions,
                    you can contact the TCN via modmail as detailed at the top of this document.

                <li>
                    Political and religious conversations are not banned outright, but as they can rapidly start drama, we discourage them as they may get out
                    of your control and result in the conversation being shut down and/or punishments.
                </li>
                <li>Personal drama and server drama, whether or not from within the TCN, is not to be discussed in global chat.</li>
